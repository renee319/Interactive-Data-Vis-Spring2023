          What is Education Attainment? 

Education attainment refers to the level of education that an individual has completed. It is typically measured in terms of degrees or diplomas earned, such as a high school diploma, a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, or a doctoral degree. Education attainment is often used as a key indicator of an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities, and it is used by employers, policymakers, and researchers to make decisions about things like job qualifications, educational programs, and funding allocations.

         I am exploring the U.S. Census Educational Attainment Data Educational Attainment in the United States: 2020 table package use statistics from the Current Population Surveys Annual Social and Economic Supplement to examine the educational to examine the educational attainment of adults aged 25 and over by demographic and social characteristics, such as age, sex, race, to understand and analysis who and what is driving different trend.

         I aimed to strike a delicate balance in this piece, offering readers both high-level insights at a glance and tools to delve deeper into the data.And I used bar chart, pie chart and line chart to understanding the following questions 

        </p>
        <p>
          Questions include: · What is the education attainment percentage from 2010 and later in the number of man and woman? 
                             · What does educational attainment look like across different races? Is there a gap between White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations for individuals aged 25 years and over who have completed 4 years of college or more between 2000 and 2022? If so, what percentage difference exists? Additionally, what is the gap in educational attainment for different races among individuals aged 25 years and over who have completed 4 years of high school or more?

                             ·Which industry employs the most people with a high school degree? What about those with an associate degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, professional degree, and doctoral degree? Additionally, what is the relationship between industry choice and educational attainment level?

          In future projects, I plan to incorporate an additional step in my design process. Rather than transitioning directly from a high-level wireframe to coding, I will ensure that each component of the dashboard, including filtered categories, is thoroughly integrated into the wireframe. This approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how all the pieces fit together holistically. By doing so, I can avoid potential late-stage changes, such as removing a category from the dashboard, conducting additional data analysis.

From a process perspective, my most significant learning experience was recognizing the value of working through the design process before starting to build. Initially, I had the idea to create a project focusing on "Women in STEM." However, as I began piecing together my initial draft, I realized that the project was too challenging for my current skill level. Not only did it take more time to retroactively add additional components, but it also resulted in messy and less readable code. Consequently, I made the decision to abandon my initial idea and start afresh, opting for a project centered around educational attainment in the Census. And thankfully this time work!

          From a technical standpoint, I acquired valuable knowledge regarding mouse interactions and the implementation of tooltips in complex charts with numerous elements.By delving into the technical aspects of D3.js, I can gain a deeper understanding of data visualization principles, data building, Data Transformation and Manipulation,Animations and interactive design, enabling me to create powerful and engaging visualizations.

        <div class="section-subhead">Conclusion</div>
        <p>
          As previously mentioned, I acknowledge that my code lacks the desired level of cleanliness, readability, and reproducibility. Given more time, I would have prioritized refactoring certain components to enhance reusability for future projects. Ideally, I would have planned my project more meticulously to incorporate these considerations from the outset.

          in future projects or a subsequent iteration of this project, I intend to place a greater emphasis on incorporating animation. Currently, when switching between categories using the dashboard's user interface, the data is appropriately filtered, and the axes smoothly transition, but the lines representing the data do not animate in a meaningful way. Addressing this aspect would contribute to a more engaging and visually appealing user experience.
